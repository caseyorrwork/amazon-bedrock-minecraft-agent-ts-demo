# Beta - Amazon Bedrock Minecraft Agent (TypeScript)

This project is a Minecraft bot built using the Agents for Amazon Bedrock framework, written in TypeScript. It demonstrates how to create an agent that can interact with the Minecraft world using the Return Control Agents.

## Introduction

The Amazon Bedrock Minecraft Agent is a TypeScript implementation of an agent that can be used to automate tasks and interactions within the Minecraft world. It leverages the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) library, which provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Minecraft game engine.

## Return Control
"Rather than sending the information that your agent has elicited from the user to a Lambda function for fulfillment, you can instead choose to return control to the agent developer by sending the information in the InvokeAgent response."


## Mineflayer Library

The Minelayer library is a powerful tool for building Minecraft agents and automating tasks within the game world. It provides a set of classes and functions that abstract away low-level details, making it easier to develop complex behaviors and interactions.

## Disclaimers

This project is a proof of concept and is not intended for production use. It is provided as an example of how to build return control agents using the Agents for Amazon Bedrock framework and the Minelayer library.
